## 📋 **EmailJS Setup Requirements**

To send **real welcome emails**, you need:

1. **EmailJS Account**: [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. **Gmail Service**: Connected to your Gmail account
3. **Email Template**: Created in EmailJS dashboard
4. **Environment Variables**: Added to your `.env` file

### **Environment Variables Needed:**
```bash
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## 🎯 **Current Behavior**

### **With EmailJS Configured:**
- ✅ Real emails sent to user's inbox
- ✅ Professional welcome email with UFA branding
- ✅ Personalized content with user's name
- ✅ Call-to-action buttons for engagement

### **Without EmailJS (Demo Mode):**
- ✅ Simulated email sending (console logs)
- ✅ Signup process works normally
- ✅ No real emails sent (for testing)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Welcome Email Not Sending:**
1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages
2. **Verify EmailJS Setup**: Ensure environment variables are correct
3. **Check Spam Folder**: Emails might end up there initially
4. **Restart Server**: After adding environment variables

### **Email Template Issues:**
1. **Template Variables**: Ensure EmailJS template uses correct variable names
2. **Template Content**: Copy the HTML template from the code
3. **Subject Line**: Use the exact subject from the template
