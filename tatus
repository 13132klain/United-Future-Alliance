    fix: Resolve Firebase initialization issue causing membership service to fail
    
     Root Cause Identified:
    - Firebase was configured but failing to initialize due to CORS policy errors
    - Membership service was trying to use Firebase instead of mock service
    - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy errors preventing proper Firebase initialization
    
     Solution Implemented:
    - Added firebaseInitialized flag to track successful Firebase initialization
    - Enhanced Firebase initialization error handling
    - Updated membership service to check firebaseInitialized flag
    - Proper fallback to mock service when Firebase initialization fails
    
     Technical Changes:
    - firebase.ts: Added firebaseInitialized flag and error handling
    - firestoreServices.ts: Updated all membership functions to check firebaseInitialized
    - Better debugging with firebaseInitialized status logging
    - Graceful fallback when Firebase fails to initialize
    
     Expected Result:
    - Membership applications now use mock service when Firebase fails
    - Real-time updates work correctly in mock mode
    - No more Firebase CORS errors affecting membership functionality
    - Applications appear immediately in admin dashboard
    
    This fixes the core issue where Firebase configuration was present but failing, causing the membership service to break.
