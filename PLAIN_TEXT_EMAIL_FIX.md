# ðŸ”§ Fixed HTML Tags in Email - Plain Text Solution

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified**
EmailJS was displaying HTML tags as plain text instead of rendering them as formatted content. This happened because EmailJS treats content as plain text by default.

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

### **What I Changed:**

1. **Removed all HTML tags** from email content
2. **Used plain text formatting** with line breaks
3. **Kept emojis and symbols** for visual appeal
4. **Used simple brackets** for button references

### **Before (Showing HTML Tags):**
```
<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Name:</strong> Clain Yemblo</p>
<p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Email:</strong> clainyemblo@gmail.com</p>
```

### **After (Clean Plain Text):**
```
Name: Clain Yemblo
Email: clainyemblo@gmail.com
```
