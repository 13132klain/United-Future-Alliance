# ðŸš€ EmailJS Real Email Setup - Complete Guide

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Create EmailJS Account**
1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your profile

### **Step 2: Set Up Gmail Service**
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to **"Email Services"**
2. Click **"Add New Service"**
3. Select **"Gmail"**
4. Click **"Connect Account"** and sign in with your Gmail
5. **Copy the Service ID** (looks like `service_xxxxxxx`)

### **Step 3: Create Email Templates**

#### **Template 1: User Welcome Email**
1. Go to **"Email Templates"** â†’ **"Create New Template"**
2. **Template Name**: `UFA User Welcome`
3. **Subject**: `Welcome to United Future Alliance!`
4. **HTML Content**: Copy the template from the code (see below)
5. **Save** the template
6. **Copy the Template ID** (looks like `template_xxxxxxx`)

#### **Template 2: Event Registration Email**
1. Create another template
2. **Template Name**: `UFA Event Registration`
3. **Subject**: `Event Registration Confirmed - {{eventTitle}}`
4. **HTML Content**: Copy the event registration template from the code
5. **Save** and copy the Template ID

#### **Template 3: Membership Confirmation Email**
1. Create another template
2. **Template Name**: `UFA Membership Confirmation`
3. **Subject**: `Membership Application Received - UFA`

3. **Copy the Public Key**

### **Step 5: Configure Environment Variables**

**Create a file named `.env` in your project root** (same folder as `package.json`) with this content:

```bash
# EmailJS Configuration
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Replace the values** with your actual credentials:
- Replace `service_xxxxxxx` with your Service ID
- Replace `template_xxxxxxx` with your Template ID (use the User Welcome template ID)
- Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your Public Key

### **Step 6: Restart Development Server**
1. **Stop your server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
2. **Start it again**: Run `npm run dev`

### **Step 7: Test Email Functionality**
1. **Go to Admin Dashboard** â†’ **Email Management**
2. **Check status**: Should show "EmailJS is configured and ready to send emails"
3. **Send test email**: Use the "Send Email" tab
4. **Test user signup**: Create a new account to test welcome emails
5. **Test event registration**: Register for an event to test automatic emails

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

After setup, you should see:
- âœ… **No more EmailJS warnings** in console
- âœ… **"EmailJS configured"** status in admin dashboard
- âœ… **Real emails sent** to your inbox
- âœ… **Professional email templates** with UFA branding

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **If emails don't work:**
1. **Check environment variables**: Make sure they start with `VITE_`
2. **Restart server**: Always restart after creating `.env`
3. **Check spam folder**: Emails might end up there initially
4. **Verify credentials**: Double-check your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
5. **Check console**: Look for any error messages

### **If you see Firebase errors:**
- These are separate from EmailJS and won't affect email functionality
- EmailJS works independently of Firebase
